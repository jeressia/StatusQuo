# StatusQuo
StatusQuo serves as a holistic solution to address disparities in sexual health. It empowers individuals to take charge of their well-being, while dismantling the social stigma surrounding STIs. With features such as QR code verification, appointment reminders, and thorough record-keeping, the app encourages transparency, routine testing, and informed choices. The roadmap for this project is promising, including plans for health portal integration, stricter user verification, discreet partner notifications, and even pill bottle scanning. This initiative signifies a major stride towards equal access to sexual health resources and knowledge, with the potential to make a substantial impact on public health.
